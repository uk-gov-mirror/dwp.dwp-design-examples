# DWP Design Examples

Point of contact / Approver: Craig Abbott

An extension to quickly get access to some of the developing patterns and 
components from DWP Design Examples.

https://github.com/dwp/design-examples/issues

## How to install

For the extension to work, you need to be running v8.7.0 of the 
[GOVUK Prototyping kit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-prototype-kit).

Install the extension with the following command in your terminal:
```
npm install dwp-design-examples
```

## Where to find the HTML / Nunjucks

In the [examples folder](https://github.com/dwp/dwp-design-examples/tree/master/examples) 
you will find a subfolder for each design. In each of these folders is a file 
called `example.html` and `example.nunjucks.html` which should contain what you 
need.

For now this is where to get the HTML or Nunjucks.

If the extension is working for people we may look to update the documentation 
on dwp-design-examples.herokuapp.com.
